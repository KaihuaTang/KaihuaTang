I'm a full-time senoir algorithm engineer. My current work mainly includes on-device LLM & VLM development and accelerating for autonomous vehicles and smart home devices. I am also keen on creating interesting applications using AIGC. Before I joined the industry, I worked on computer vision during my PhD (I was selected as one of the worldâ€™s [top 2% research scientists](https://topresearcherslist.com/Home/Search?AuthFull=tang%2C+kaihua)), and mobile game development during my Master (I developed two indie IOS games in 2015 and also took a internship at miHoYo in 2017). **My lifelong dream is to contribute to the development of a world-changing products that benefit millions of people.**
