I'm a full-time senoir algorithm engineer and researcher. My current work mainly includes on-device LLM & VLM deployment and inference speedup. I am also keen on creating engaging applications using AIGC. Before I joined the industry, I worked on computer vision research during my PhD (I was selected as one of the worldâ€™s top [2% research scientists](https://topresearcherslist.com/Home/Search?AuthFull=tang%2C+kaihua)(7566 out of 399064 in Artificial Intelligence).) and mobile game development during internship. My lifelong dream is to empower video games with more intelligence in the gameplay.
