I'm a full-time senoir algorithm engineer and a spare-time open-sourcerer. My current work mainly includes on-device LLM deployment and inference speedup. I have also worked on computer vision research and mobile game development. My lifelong dream is to empower video games with more intelligence in the gameplay.

**If my open source projects have inspired you, giving me some sponsorship will be a great help to my subsequent open source work.**
